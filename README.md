# All_Base_Convertion
I have tried to write a simple code to convert bases. I have written separate code to do that separately.
But, Here user can do this together except hexadecimal to decimal convertion. That means I have gathered those codes in one script. I wrote and uploaded this code on a mobile app. So remove the (.py3) extentention and make it (.py)
.
To start this script user have to follow these instruction given below. 
- First of all user have to decide what he/she want. 
- Enter 1 or 2
- Then enter a value which will contain your test case number.
- Now input the number.
- Then base.
#Done!!! Happy_Coding ;)
